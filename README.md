# Calculator
Calculator exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)

[Live Demo](https://lisas7.github.io/TOP-Calculator/)

What I learned:
* Creating a grid with flexbox
* HTML output element
* Using the calc() function in CSS (subsequently removed as it was messing up the display border)
